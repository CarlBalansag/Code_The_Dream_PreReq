a X button when Song is playing to get back into view all mode same UI as random song 

finish play random song button

when next or previous is pressed and no next song play liked song like randomized

current issues when connecting to device autmatically takes to live song, fix can be setting song = null

better warning for no device connected

back to info not working, maybe gotta disconnect device

make artist size smaller and use extra size on top tracks
