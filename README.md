Spotify Code The Dream Pre-Work

The Project is still under development mode, spotify limits 20 users to access the project when it is under the development mode, I have emailed "admissions@codethedream.org" for emails that is linked with spotify accounts who are trying to access the project so I can add them to gain access

1) Log in to spotify with the email that was provided to be able to gain access when in development mode. 

2) Work in progress
